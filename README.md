# 📝 Before You Regret It (BYRI)

**Before You Regret It** is a web app that helps you double-check your posts, tweets, or messages before you hit “Send.”  
It uses AI to highlight parts of your text that might come off negatively, be misinterpreted, or cause future regret — and then suggests safer rewrites while keeping your style intact.
